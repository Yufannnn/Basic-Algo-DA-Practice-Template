    "*Introduction*:\n",

    "*Algorithm Overview*:\n",
    "- \"To tackle this problem, we'll employ a backtracking algorithm.\"\n",
    "- \"Backtracking is a systematic way of exploring all possible configurations or solutions by trying out different choices and backtracking when a choice doesn't lead to a valid solution.\"\n",

    "1. **Backtracking Function**:\n",
    "   - \"We'll define a recursive function named `backtrack` that takes a start index as an argument.\"\n",
    "   - \"This function will represent our backtracking strategy, where we explore different choices of elements to form permutations.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Base Case**:\n",
    "   - \"At each step of the recursion, if the start index reaches the length of the array `nums`, it means we've formed a complete permutation.\"\n",
    "   - \"So, we'll append the current permutation to our result list and return.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exploring Choices**:\n",
    "   - \"For each index from the start index to the end of the array, we'll consider the current element as a potential candidate for the next position in the permutation.\"\n",
    "   - \"We'll swap the current element with the element at the start index to explore this choice.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Recursive Call**:\n",
    "   - \"After swapping, we'll add the current element to the current permutation and make a recursive call to `backtrack` with the next start index.\"\n",
    "   - \"This recursive call explores further choices and continues until we reach the base case.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Backtracking**:\n",
    "   - \"After the recursive call returns, indicating that we've explored all permutations starting from the current element, we backtrack.\"\n",
    "   - \"We remove the current element from the permutation and restore the original array by swapping the elements back.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "*Initialization*:\n",
    "- \"To start the process, we initialize an empty list `result` to store the permutations.\"\n",
    "- \"We also initialize an empty list `curr_perm` to keep track of the current permutation.\"\n",

    "1. **Sorting Candidates**:\n",
    "   - \"To handle duplicates and ensure unique combinations, we start by sorting the candidates list.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Backtracking Function**:\n",
    "   - \"We define a backtracking function named `backtrack` to generate all unique combinations recursively.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Base Case**:\n",
    "   - \"The base case of the recursion occurs when the target becomes 0.\"\n",
    "   - \"This indicates that we have found a valid combination that sums up to the target.\"\n",
    "   - \"At this point, we add the current combination to the result list.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Choosing Elements**:\n",
    "   - \"Within the `backtrack` function, we iterate over the candidates starting from the current index.\"\n",
    "   - \"We skip duplicates by checking if the current candidate is the same as the previous one.\"\n",
    "   - \"If the current candidate is greater than the remaining target, we break the loop.\"\n",
    "   - \"Otherwise, we include the current candidate in the current combination and recursively call the `backtrack` function with the next index and updated target.\"\n",
    "   - \"After exploring all possible combinations with the current candidate, we backtrack by removing it from the combination.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Starting Backtracking**:\n",
    "   - \"We initiate the backtracking process by calling the `backtrack` function with an empty path (initial combination) and the target.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Result**:\n",
    "   - \"The result list contains all unique combinations of candidates that sum up to the target.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity Analysis**:\n",
    "- \"The time complexity depends on the number of unique combinations generated.\"\n",
    "- \"Sorting the candidates list takes O(n log n) time.\"\n",
    "- \"In the worst case, where all combinations sum up to the target, the time complexity is exponential.\"\n",
    "- \"The space complexity is determined by the depth of the recursive call stack and the space needed for the result list.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "*Conclusion*:\n",
    "- \"The backtracking approach efficiently explores all unique combinations of candidates that sum up to the target, while handling duplicates.\"\n",
    "- \"Despite the potential exponential time complexity, the algorithm provides an effective solution to the problem.\""
