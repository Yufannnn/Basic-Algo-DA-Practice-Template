    "\n",
    "\"In the `RandomizedSet` class, we aim to achieve O(1) average time complexity for three operations: insert, remove, and getRandom. To do this, we use a combination of a list and a dictionary (hash map). The list maintains the elements of the set for quick access to random elements, and the dictionary maps values to their indices in the list for quick lookups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation of Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - We start by initializing our data structure with two empty data types: a list (`self.list`) that will store the elements, and a dictionary (`self.dict`) that will map the value to its index in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Insert Method (`insert(val)`)**:\n",
    "   - When we insert an element, we first check if the element is already in our dictionary. If it is, we return `False` because the element cannot be inserted twice.\n",
    "   - If it's not present, we add the element to the list and record its index in the dictionary, then return `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Remove Method (`remove(val)`)**:\n",
    "   - To remove an element, we check if it's in the dictionary. If it's not, we return `False` since there's nothing to remove.\n",
    "   - If the element is present, we locate it in the list using the dictionary. To maintain O(1) time complexity for removal, we swap the element with the last element in the list, update the dictionary to reflect this change, and then pop the last element from the list. This ensures that the list remains contiguous without gaps. We then delete the element from the dictionary and return `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **GetRandom Method (`getRandom()`)**:\n",
    "   - For returning a random element, we use `random.choice(self.list)`, which provides a random element from the list with uniform distribution, since any element is equally likely to be chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insert Operation**: O(1) on average due to dictionary hash mapping.\n",
    "- **Remove Operation**: O(1) on average by swapping with the last element and then removing it, avoiding the need to shift elements.\n",
    "- **GetRandom Operation**: O(1) because accessing a random index in a list is a constant time operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `RandomizedSet` class efficiently implements a set with the ability to insert, remove, and return a random element in average constant time. The judicious use of a list along with a hash map allows this data structure to perform these operations quickly and effectively, suitable for scenarios where such operations need to be performed frequently and efficiently.\""

    "# Linked List Random Node\n",
    "\n",
    "\"In the `Solution` class, we're dealing with a problem of selecting a random node from a singly linked list such that each node has an equal probability of being chosen. To solve this problem, we use a strategy called reservoir sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation of the Reservoir Sampling Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - We start by initializing our 'reservoir' with the value of the head node, which is the first node in our list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterating Through the List**:\n",
    "   - We then iterate through the list starting from the second node (since the first is already in our reservoir).\n",
    "   - At each node, we generate a random number and determine if we should replace the value in our reservoir with the value of the current node. The probability of the replacement is `1/i`, where `i` is the index of the current node (starting with 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Probability Calculation**:\n",
    "   - The magic of reservoir sampling lies in this probability calculation. For example, when we're at the second node, it has a 1/2 chance of replacing the head node in the reservoir. When we're at the third node, it has a 1/3 chance of replacing the current reservoir value, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **End Result**:\n",
    "   - By the time we reach the end of the list, each node has had an equal opportunity to be selected because the probability of any node being chosen gets smaller as we continue to iterate through the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Returning the Random Node Value**:\n",
    "   - After traversing the entire list, we return the value stored in the reservoir, which now represents a randomly selected node's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Solution Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Reservoir sampling is perfect for this problem because it provides a simple yet powerful way of ensuring a uniform distribution of selection probability across a list whose length is not known in advance or is too large to handle in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization**: O(1), as we're simply storing the head of the list.\n",
    "- **GetRandom Method**: O(n), where n is the length of the list. This is because, in the worst case, we traverse the entire list. However, the algorithm ensures that each call to `getRandom` results in a random node being chosen with equal probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Solution` class demonstrates an efficient approach to a common problem that can arise in situations where we need to sample randomly from a large or streaming dataset. It's a practical application of probability and shows the power of reservoir sampling in action.\"\n"

    "\n",
    "**Overview of the Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The class is designed to randomly pick an index from an array, where the chance of picking each index is weighted by the values provided in the input array `w`. This problem requires a solution that accounts for the weights, ensuring that indices with higher weights are more likely to be picked.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation Details:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization (`__init__` method):**\n",
    "   - During initialization, we compute the prefix sums of the weights. This transforms the weights array into a series of increasing values, each representing the cumulative weight from the start of the array up to that point.\n",
    "   - The last value of the prefix sums array represents the total sum of weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Picking an Index (`pickIndex` method):**\n",
    "   - To pick an index, we generate a random number `target` between 1 and the total sum of the weights. This random number effectively selects a 'position' within the total weight.\n",
    "   - We then use binary search (`bisect.bisect_left`) to find the index of the smallest number in the prefix sums array that is greater than or equal to `target`. This index corresponds to the weight interval that `target` falls into, and thus, the index to be picked.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The use of prefix sums and a random target within the total weight range ensures that each index is picked with a probability proportional to its weight. Higher weights occupy a larger 'space' in the cumulative distribution, increasing the likelihood that the random target falls within their range.\n",
    "- Binary search makes finding the target index efficient, even for large arrays, maintaining the overall O(log n) time complexity for the `pickIndex` operation, where n is the number of elements in `w`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for storing the prefix sums, where n is the length of the input array `w`.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** \n",
    "  - O(n) for the `__init__` method to compute the prefix sums.\n",
    "  - O(log n) for the `pickIndex` method due to the binary search operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Usage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider `w = [1, 3]`. The prefix sums will be `[1, 4]`, and the total sum is 4. If the random target is 1, `pickIndex` returns 0 (index 0). If the target is 3 or 4, `pickIndex` returns 1 (index 1), reflecting the weighted probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Solution` class offers a clever and efficient way to implement weighted random selection. By leveraging prefix sums and binary search, it ensures that each index is selected with the correct probability, in line with its weight relative to the sum of all weights."

    "# Random Pick With Blacklist\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to design an algorithm to efficiently pick a random number within `[0, n - 1]`, excluding any numbers in the blacklist. The main challenge is to do this efficiently, minimizing the usage of the random function and ensuring that each non-blacklisted number has an equal probability of being chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation Details:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization (`__init__` method):**\n",
    "   - **Blacklist Processing**: First, the blacklist is converted to a set for efficient lookups. This is crucial to avoid timeouts during large input cases.\n",
    "   - **Adjusting `N`**: The effective `N` is recalculated to be `N - len(blacklist)`. This reflects the total number of valid (non-blacklisted) numbers.\n",
    "   - **Creating Mappings**: The algorithm then creates a mapping for blacklisted numbers within the valid range `[0, self.N)`. Each blacklisted number in this range is mapped to a non-blacklisted number in the upper range `[self.N, N)`. This is done by generating two lists: `key` (blacklisted numbers in the valid range) and `val` (non-blacklisted numbers in the upper range), and then zipping them into a dictionary `self.mapping`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Picking a Number (`pick` method):**\n",
    "   - A random number `i` is selected in the range `[0, self.N - 1]`. This range is guaranteed to be free of blacklisted numbers due to the adjustment of `N`.\n",
    "   - The algorithm then checks if `i` is in the mapping (i.e., it was originally a blacklisted number within the valid range). If it is, the number is mapped to a corresponding non-blacklisted number in the upper range. If not, `i` is directly returned.\n",
    "   - This ensures that any pick is valid and accounts for the exclusion of blacklisted numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Equal Probability**: The remapping ensures that each non-blacklisted number in `[0, n - 1]` has an equal chance of being picked. The effective range `[0, self.N)` is directly accessible, and any mapped numbers replace blacklisted numbers with valid options.\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: By minimizing the role of the blacklist to a simple remapping for a subset of numbers, the algorithm avoids repeatedly calling the random function to find a non-blacklisted number. This is especially important for large values of `n` and significant sizes of the blacklist.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(B), where B is the length of the blacklist. This accounts for the storage of the mapping dictionary and the set conversion of the blacklist.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \n",
    "  - The initialization (`__init__`) has a complexity of O(B) due to the processing of the blacklist.\n",
    "  - The `pick` operation is O(1), as it involves generating a single random number and possibly looking up a value in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Usage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For an instance `Solution(7, [2, 3, 5])`, the valid picks are `[0, 1, 4, 6]`. The remapping ensures that any random selection within `[0, self.N)` (which is `[0, 4)` in this case) results in a valid pick, with each number having an equal probability of being chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution presents a clever use of mapping to efficiently solve the problem of picking a random number from a modified range, accounting for exclusions specified by a blacklist. It demonstrates a sophisticated approach to probability and randomness, ensuring fairness and efficiency."
