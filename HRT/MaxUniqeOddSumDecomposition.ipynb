    "The problem statement is asking for a way to decompose an integer into the maximum number of unique odd summands, which, when summed, equal the original integer. To solve this problem, we can iteratively subtract the smallest available odd number that has not been used in the decomposition yet, ensuring that the remainder can still be decomposed into unique odd summands.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation Script:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\"When we need to decompose an integer into the maximum number of unique odd summands, we start with the smallest odd number, which is 1, and continue to subtract the next smallest odd number that hasn't been used. However, we must be cautious to ensure that the remaining integer can still be broken down into further unique odd summands. If at any point we can't proceed without repeating an odd summand, we must adjust the last summand to be the sum of itself and the remaining number, which will also be an odd number.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if we're decomposing the number 15, we'd start with 1, then 3, but instead of choosing 5 next (which would only leave us with 6, that can't be broken down into two more unique odd summands), we jump to 11, which gives us the decomposition of 1, 3, and 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's put this into code by creating a Python function that implements this logic.\""
