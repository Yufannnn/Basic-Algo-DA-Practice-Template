    "# Longest Path With Different Adjacent Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution Overview**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tree Construction**:\n",
    "   - The solution first constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree using a `defaultdict(list)`. It iterates through the `parent` array to fill this adjacency list, effectively mapping each parent node to its children.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DFS Implementation**:\n",
    "   - A recursive DFS function `dfs(node)` is defined and called starting from the root node (`node 0`). This function is designed to traverse the tree and calculate the longest path where consecutive characters are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Path Length Calculation**:\n",
    "   - For each node, the DFS explores all its children and calculates the path lengths. It keeps track of the two longest paths (`longest` and `second_longest`) that descend from the current node and do not have the same character as the current node. This is important because the longest path in the tree might be the sum of two paths descending from a common ancestor, rather than a single direct path.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Global Maximum Update**:\n",
    "   - The variable `self.maxLength` is updated to keep track of the maximum length found during the DFS. For each node, it considers the sum of the lengths of the two longest descending paths plus one (for the current node) if the paths have different characters than the current node. This effectively accounts for paths that go down one branch and then up another.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Returning the Result**:\n",
    "   - Finally, `dfs(0)` is called to start the traversal from the root, and `self.maxLength` is returned after the DFS completes, giving the length of the longest valid path.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity Analysis**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited exactly once during the DFS.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(N) for storing the adjacency list representation of the tree and the recursion stack used by DFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insights**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The solution elegantly combines tree construction, DFS traversal, and dynamic updating of the longest path lengths to solve the problem efficiently.\n",
    "- By tracking both the longest and the second-longest paths descending from each node, the solution can handle cases where the longest path in the tree requires \"turning\" at a node, moving from one branch to another.\n",
    "- The use of `self.maxLength` as a class variable to track the global maximum is a clever way to update and access the longest path length across recursive DFS calls."
