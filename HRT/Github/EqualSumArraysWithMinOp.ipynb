    "# Equal Sum Arrays With Minimum Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Sum Calculation**:\n",
    "   - The method begins by calculating the sums of `nums1` and `nums2`. If the sums are already equal, it returns `0` as no operations are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Array Swap for Simplification**:\n",
    "   - If `sum1` is greater than `sum2`, the arrays and their sums are swapped. This step simplifies the logic that follows by ensuring that `nums1` is always the array with the smaller sum, focusing on increasing its sum or decreasing the sum of `nums2` to achieve equality.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Potential Changes Calculation**:\n",
    "   - The code calculates the potential changes for each number in both arrays to contribute towards equalizing the sums. For `nums1`, the change is how much each number can increase (`6 - x`), and for `nums2`, the change is how much each number can decrease (`x - 1`). These changes are then sorted in descending order to prioritize the changes that have the largest impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Applying Changes**:\n",
    "   - The method iterates through the sorted list of changes, applying each change to reduce the difference between `sum2` and `sum1`. With each operation, the difference `diff` is reduced by the change value, and the operation counter `ops` is incremented.\n",
    "   - If at any point the difference `diff` becomes less than or equal to `0`, the method returns the current count of operations, `ops`, as it signifies that the sums have been equalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Return Result**:\n",
    "   - If the method iterates through all possible changes without reducing the difference to `0` or less, it concludes that it is not possible to equalize the sums with the available operations and returns `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity Analysis**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(N log N), where N is the total number of elements in both `nums1` and `nums2`. The sorting of potential changes dictates the time complexity.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(N), due to the space required for storing the list of potential changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Walkthrough**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the example `nums1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6]` and `nums2 = [1,1,2,2,2,2]`. After calculating initial sums and potential changes, the solution sorts the potential changes: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. It then applies the three largest changes (`5`, `4`, and `3`) to equalize the sums, requiring `3` operations."
