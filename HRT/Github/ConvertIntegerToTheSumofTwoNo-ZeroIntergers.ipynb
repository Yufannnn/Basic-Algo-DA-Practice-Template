    "**Solution Overview**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem aims to find two non-zero integers whose sum equals the given integer `n`. The solution uses a simple approach to iterate through possible pairs of integers until a pair is found where both numbers do not contain any zero digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm Steps**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Helper Function**:\n",
    "   - Define a helper function `containsZero(num)` to check if a given number contains any zero digit. This function converts the number to a string and checks if '0' is present in its decimal representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - Initialize two integers `a` and `b` with values `1` and `n - 1`, respectively. These integers represent the two non-zero numbers whose sum equals `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iterative Search**:\n",
    "   - Iterate in a loop until both `a` and `b` do not contain any zero digits.\n",
    "   - Inside the loop, increment `a` and decrement `b` by `1` in each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Result**:\n",
    "   - Once both `a` and `b` are found such that they do not contain any zero digits, return them as a list `[a, b]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity Analysis**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution depends on the number `n`. However, since the loop iterates through a range of numbers proportional to `n`, the time complexity is O(n).\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) as the solution uses a constant amount of extra space for variables, regardless of the input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution effectively finds two non-zero integers whose sum equals the given integer `n`. It provides a straightforward and efficient approach to solving the problem, adhering to the problem constraints and requirements."
