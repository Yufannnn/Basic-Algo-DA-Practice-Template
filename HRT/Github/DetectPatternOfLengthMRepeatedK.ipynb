    "# Detect Pattern of Length M Repeated K or More Times\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution Overview**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem requires finding a pattern of length `m` that repeats `k` or more times consecutively in the given array `arr`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm Steps**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Iterate Through Array**:\n",
    "   - Iterate through the array up to the point where there's enough room for the pattern to repeat `k` times consecutively without overlapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check Patterns**:\n",
    "   - Extract a pattern of length `m` starting at each index of the array.\n",
    "   - Check if this pattern repeats `k` or more times consecutively in the array by comparing slices of the array.\n",
    "   - If a pattern is found that repeats `k` or more times, return True.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Return Result**:\n",
    "   - If no such pattern is found, return False.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity Analysis**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(n * m * k), where:\n",
    "  - `n` is the length of the array `arr`.\n",
    "  - `m` is the length of the pattern.\n",
    "  - `k` is the minimum number of repetitions required.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) as no extra space is used except for a few variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution effectively detects a pattern of length `m` that repeats `k` or more times consecutively in the given array `arr`. It iterates through the array and checks for patterns at each index, adhering to the problem constraints and requirements.\n"
