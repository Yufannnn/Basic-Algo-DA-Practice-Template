    "# 24 Games\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution Overview**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem involves finding if it's possible to arrange the four given numbers using arithmetic operations ('+', '-', '*', '/') to evaluate to 24. The solution utilizes a recursive DFS algorithm to explore all possible combinations of operations on the given numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm Steps**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Case**:\n",
    "   - If there are no numbers left to process (i.e., `n == 1`), check if the remaining number is approximately equal to 24. Return `True` if it is, else return `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DFS Exploration**:\n",
    "   - Iterate through each pair of numbers in the current list of numbers (`nums`).\n",
    "   - For each pair `(a, b)`, remove `b` from `nums` and temporarily set it as the last element (for reduction).\n",
    "   - Generate all possible outcomes by applying arithmetic operations on `a` and `b`. These operations include addition, subtraction (both ways), multiplication, and division (both ways, with checks to avoid division by zero).\n",
    "   - Recursively call the DFS function with the updated `nums` list (one less number) to explore further combinations.\n",
    "   - If any combination leads to a result approximately equal to 24, return `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Backtracking**:\n",
    "   - After exploring all possible outcomes for a pair `(a, b)`, restore the original values of `a` and `b` in `nums` for backtracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return Result**:\n",
    "   - If no combination of operations leads to a result approximately equal to 24, return `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity Analysis**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: The DFS explores all possible combinations of operations on the given numbers, leading to a time complexity that depends on the number of permutations of the four numbers. However, since the number of combinations is fixed (i.e., 4!), the time complexity is considered constant.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) as the solution uses a constant amount of extra space for variables, regardless of the input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The DFS approach efficiently explores all possible combinations of operations on the given numbers to determine if it's possible to obtain the value 24. It adheres to the problem constraints and provides an optimal solution for checking the solvability of the \"24 Game\"."
