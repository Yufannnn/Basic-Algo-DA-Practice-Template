    "**Solution Overview**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem requires finding the maximum number that can be obtained by changing at most one digit in the given positive integer `num`, where '6' can be changed to '9' and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm Steps**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convert to List**:\n",
    "   - Convert the given integer `num` to a list of characters for easy manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterative Replacement**:\n",
    "   - Iterate through the list representation of `num`.\n",
    "   - If a '6' is found, replace it with '9' to obtain a larger number.\n",
    "   - Break the loop after the first replacement, as we only need to change one digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Convert Back**:\n",
    "   - Convert the modified list back to an integer.\n",
    "   - Return the resulting integer as the maximum number.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity Analysis**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(log(num)) as it depends on the number of digits in `num`.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(log(num)) as well, considering the space used to convert the integer to a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution effectively finds the maximum number by changing at most one digit in the given positive integer `num`. It provides a simple and efficient approach to solving the problem, adhering to the problem constraints and requirements."
