These variables will be updated as we iterate through the list of prices.\n","\n","3. **Iterate Through Prices**: As we loop through each price in the list, we perform two operations:\n","   - **Update `min_price`**: We compare the current price with `min_price` and update `min_price` to be the lesser of the two. This ensures that we always know the lowest price we could buy the stock for up to the current day.\n","   - **Calculate and Update `max_profit`**: We calculate the profit we could achieve if we bought at the lowest price so far (`min_price`) and sold at the current price. If this profit is higher than `max_profit`, we update `max_profit` accordingly.\n","\n","4. **Return Maximum Profit**: After iterating through all prices, `max_profit` contains the maximum profit that could be achieved with a single buy-sell transaction. We return this value.\n","\n","**Why This Solution Works:**\n","\n","The elegance of this solution lies in its simplicity and efficiency. By keeping track of the minimum purchase price and the maximum sell profit concurrently, we ensure that we are always considering the optimal buy-sell pair without the need for nested iterations. This results in a linear time complexity of O(N), making it highly efficient for even large lists of prices.\n","\n","**Conclusion:**\n","\n","In summary, this method provides a clear and optimal solution to the maximum profit problem by leveraging a single-pass strategy and constant space usage, except for the input prices list.

Unlike the previous solution that focuses on finding the single best buy-sell pair, this method seeks to accumulate profit over every upward trend in the stock prices.\n","\n","**Explanation of the Approach:**\n","\n","1. **Preliminary Check**: We start by checking if the `prices` list is empty. If it is, we return 0 since no transactions can be made without any price data.\n","\n","2. **Initialize Profit**: We set `max_profit` to 0, which we'll use to accumulate our total profit from trading.\n","\n","3. **Iterate Through Prices**: The core of our strategy involves iterating through the list of prices starting from the second day (index 1). For each day, we compare the current day's price to the previous day's price.\n","\n","4. **Capture Profitable Transactions**: Whenever we observe that today's price (`prices[i]`) is greater than yesterday's price (`prices[i - 1]`), we interpret this as a profitable opportunity to buy the stock yesterday and sell it today. We add this profit (`prices[i] - prices[i - 1]`) to our accumulated `max_profit`.\n","\n","5. **Return Accumulated Profit**: After going through all the prices, `max_profit` will contain the total profit earned from all the transactions made following this strategy.\n","\n","**Why This Solution Works:**\n","\n","This method effectively takes advantage of every profit opportunity presented by an increase in stock prices from one day to the next. It aligns with the idea that maximizing profit can be achieved by buying on every day that is followed by a higher price and selling on the next day, thus capturing the profit from these incremental increases.\n","\n","**Complexity Analysis:**\n","\n","The time complexity of this approach is O(N), where N is the number of days, because it involves a single pass through the list of prices.

It handles two scenarios separately: one where `k` is large enough that the problem reduces to making as many transactions as we want, similar to the 'Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II' scenario, and the other where `k` is smaller, requiring a more traditional dynamic programming approach.\n","\n","**When `k` is Large:**\n","\n","1. **Large `k` Handling**: If `k` is at least half the number of days, we can simply iterate through the list of prices, summing up all positive price differences between consecutive days.
